# WinnerMicro W60X: development platform for [PlatformIO](http://platformio.org)

"W600 is an embedded Wi-Fi SoC chip which is complying with IEEE802.11b/g/n international standard and which supports multi interface, multi protocol. It can be easily applied to smart appliances, smart home, health care, smart toy, wireless audio & video, industrial and other IoT fields. This SoC integrates Cortex-M3 CPU, Flash, RF Transceiver, CMOS PA, BaseBand. It applies multi interfaces such as SPI, UART, GPIO, I2C, PWM, I2S, 7816. It applies multi encryption and decryption protocol such as PRNG/SHA1/MD5/RC4/DES/3DES/AES/CRC/RSA."

I personally own 7 of the [ThingsTurn TB-01 Devkit](https://github.com/sammothxc/w60x-documentation/tree/main/tb-01-devkit-master) boards with the W600 chip.

## PlatformIO Usage

Put this in your `platformio.ini`

```ini
[platformio]
; select your default environment here
default_envs = generic_w600

[env:wio_w600]
platform = https://github.com/sammothxc/platform-w60x
board = wio_w600
framework = arduino ; or wm60x-sdk

[env:wizfi360_evb_mini]
platform = https://github.com/sammothxc/platform-w60x
board = wizfi360_evb_mini
framework = arduino ; or wm60x-sdk

[env:tb_01]
platform = https://github.com/sammothxc/platform-w60x
board = tb_01
framework = arduino ; or wm60x-sdk

[env:generic_w600]
platform = https://github.com/sammothxc/platform-w60x
board = generic_w600
framework = arduino ; or wm60x-sdk
```

## Flashing with PlatformIO

In order for it to accept new firmware from PlatformIO, you have to hold down the `KEY` button (most  likely `PA0` to `GND` on other boards) while powering on. You can release it once the PlatformIO console begins to show progress.

## Datasheets and Other Documentation
Check out [sammothxc/w60x-documentation](https://github.com/sammothxc/w60x-documentation), [My Project Wiki Page on the W60x](https://wiki.samwarr.dev/en/w60x), and [sammothxc/framework-arduino-w60x](https://github.com/sammothxc/framework-arduino-w60x)

W60x uses Cortex-M3, which needs [toolchain-gccarmnoneeabi](https://registry.platformio.org/tools/platformio/toolchain-gccarmnoneeabi)
